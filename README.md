# airbnb

The script airbnb.py analyses Airbnb data contained in contacts.csv, users.csv and listings.csv. Contacts.csv contains all of the messages between users, listings.csv contains the relevant home listing, and users.csv contains the users on the system. Findings are that number of contacts per listing is most closely associated with a favourable booking outcome. Interestingly Bolivians are discriminated against when booking appartments in Rio.
